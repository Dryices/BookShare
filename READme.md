# BookShare 
BookShare is an app that allows users to resell their used books and course notes to others in Singapore. It is inspired by [Carousell](https://www.Carousell.com) as it has
a similar concept where users can sell and buy items on a unified platform. The main difference of BookShare is that it allows users to exclusively sell educational materials 
to each other. The main target of the app is students, teachers, lecturers, professors and parents. 

Most students in Singapore use assessment books, course notes or online resources for use in their learning in their educations. Currently pre- and post-secondary institution continue using physical books and notes. 
The problem is once students finish using these books or notes, they will mostly likely be collecting dust at home while some will be sold or donated to their friends who need it.  

From what I observe while being in school, most of my friends will buy new course notes or books every semester and once the semester ends, they will either discard their course 
notes or leave it to rot at home. These are wasteful habits that may be detrimental to the environment in the long run. These books and notes could have been reused and passed on 
to future students that are taking on the same subject, module, or course.
